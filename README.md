# sphere_exchange
Exchange FQH anyons on the sphere.

This repository contains several separate routines to help with calculation:

admissibility_full.jl : generate a list of all admissible root
get_jack.py : generate all jack polynomials given a list of admissible root (./jack routine required, not included here)
PotentialPins_parallel.jl : calculate the exchange phase on the sphere at different azimuthal angles \theta
plot_phase.py : plot the data

Detailed instructions to be updated later...
